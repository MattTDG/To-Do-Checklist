To-Do Checklist

Description
This project is a simple interactive to-do list where tasks are categorized into "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done." The tasks are displayed with checkboxes, and when a checkbox is clicked, a celebratory star icon "pops up" to give feedback to the user. The layout is styled using CSS and includes a background image for added visual appeal.
